# Husky-Navigation-Mobile

[In Progress]

Mobile version of Husky Navigation implemented with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) cross-platform framework for Android and iOS.

Access the published development version [here](https://expo.dev/@aferman/husky-navigation-mobile-test-1) with [Expo client](https://expo.dev/client) app.

To modify project, clone repository and install Expo-CLI via npm globally with `npm i -g expo-cli`. Run `expo start` to start the Expo server. With the Expo server active, you can run a local version of Husky-Navigation-Mobile on any device connected to the same network as your computer through the Expo client. You can also debug by enabling debugging through the developer menu in the Expo app, which is accessed by shaking your phone while the app is active.
